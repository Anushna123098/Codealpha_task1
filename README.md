## 🧠 How It Works

- The UI contains buttons for digits (0–9), operators (+, −, ×, ÷), a clear button (C), and an equal button (=).
- JavaScript handles the click events on each button and updates the display accordingly.
- When the user clicks "=", the expression is evaluated, and the result is shown.
